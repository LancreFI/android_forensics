My random scripts to help with Android forensics


extfile.sh:
This script decompresses zlib packed content from you extracted Android backup!


lockremove.sh:
A quick script to remove a known password/pin/patter screen lock of an android device. 
ONLY FOR KNOWN PASSWORDS! THIS DOES NOT ENABLE YOU TO REMOVE THE SCREEN LOCK IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW THE PASSWORD!
